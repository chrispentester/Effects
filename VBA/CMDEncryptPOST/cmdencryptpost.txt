' Run commands then RC4 Encrypt then POST to a web server.
' Create an office document that accepts macros, Alt F11 to open VBA, then right click and Insert > Module.
' Paste the following VBA script into the module. Modify commands as needed, and modify X.X.X.X with the ip address to POST to.
' Play the macro, and the commands will run, then be RC4 encrypted with the password 'strongpassword', then converted to Hex.
' Each command will be sent as a POST to the receiving ip address as Hex strings. 
' Copy each hex string received (POST Data field) in the web log into https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
' For the recipe, add "From Hex" then "RC4 Drop" and type in the password.
